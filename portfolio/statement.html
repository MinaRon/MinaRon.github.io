    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
    <h2>Seeking inspiration and capturing memories is a part of who I am as an individual to my mind and heart. As a student, I like to meet and make friends with new people to expand inspiration for myself and others.
    My style of art often consists of drawing graffiti fonts and crazy cartoon-like characters, inspired by Japanese artist, Takashi Murakami.</h2>
