	<p>You chose red. This means you have a love of fire and blood, also relating to energy, war, danger, strength, power, determination as well as passion, desire, and love. You're emotionally intense, and human metabolism and blood pressure increases. Are you crushing on anybody?</p>

	<h1>“Red", I write "is the color of life. It's blood, passion, rage. It's menstrual flow and after birth. Beginnings and violent end. Red is the color of love. Beating hearts and hungry lips. Roses, Valentines, cherries. Red is the color of shame. Crimson cheeks and spilled blood. Broken hearts, opened veins. A burning desire to return to white.” 
 ―Mary Hogan, Pretty Face</h1>
