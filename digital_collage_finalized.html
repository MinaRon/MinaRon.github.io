	<h1>This project depicts the lead singer of my favorite band who died of committing suicide in July 2017. His name is Chester Bennington, lead singer of the band, Linkin Park. In my experiences, Bennington was one of the legends who died at a young age, and I believe even if he may no longer be in our society, Linkin Park is still one of the people's favorite music group, even me too. The whole message of this digital collage to me says that legends who die, no matter how old or young they are, are always remembered, just like every loved one we lose.</h1>
